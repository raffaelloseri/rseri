Measurement theory is "a field of study that examines the attribution of values to traits, characteristics, or constructs. Measurement theory focuses on assessing the true score of an attribute, such that an obtained value has a close correspondence with the actual quantity" (APA Dictionary of Psychology, 2nd ed., 2015). There are at least two different approaches to measurement, one based on statistical descriptive models, corresponding to a subset of *psychometrics*, and another one based on mathematical axiomatic models, corresponding to a subset of *mathematical psychology*.
