abstract: "The unsustainable use and disposal of plastics is causing persistent and widespread environmental
contamination. In particular, the pervasiveness of microplastics (MPs) in wastewater has become a
major environmental issue in aquatic ecosystems and may cause adverse health effects for humans
and other living organisms.
The present paper presents the socio-economic framework included, in parallel with the technical and
technological research path, in the Protein from Plastic (ProPla) project, granted by Fondazione Cariplo.
Within the above scenario, ProPla aims at developing an innovative biotechnological application to
recover PET microplastics (microPET) from wastewater and exploit the power of protein engineering and
system biology approaches to generate a novel bacterial strain able to convert microPET into amino
acids, that can be used in many industries (food, cosmetics, etc.) in a circular bioeconomy perspective.
The socio-economy framework includes both a patent landscape analysis (PLA) and a socio-economic
assessment, aiming to highlight the system of values and the economic opportunities embodied in the
process.
The PLA had a crucial importance to map the main technological trends related to the ProPla process,
highlighting opportunities with significant potential economic return for the isolation of MPs from water,
their characterization and the set-up of a novel E.coli strain for the conversion of PET into amino acids.
The socio-economic assessment aimed at underlining the multiple direct and indirect values arising
from the project outcomes and products. The issue of the economic feasibility of microPET conversion
into value-added products has been highlighted, together with the evidence of the potential social and
economic benefits coming from the valorisation of microPET by way of a bio-based conversion process.
Finally, an analysis has been developed to emphasize the contribute of the overall project results in the
achievement of SDGs, at a public level, and of ESG, at a firm level."
