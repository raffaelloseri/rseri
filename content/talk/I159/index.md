abstract: "The traditional way to verify the adequacy of a theory to the data has been to perform a single experiment in which the assumptions underlying the theory are tested. While one experiment in itself is not sufficient to guarantee the acceptance or the rejection of a theory, attempts to replicate an already performed experiment have often been met with skepticism. Big team science has the potential to overcome this, making it possible to perform several instances of the same experiment in different countries and contexts and to considerably increase the sample size."
