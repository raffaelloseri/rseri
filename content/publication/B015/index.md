abstract: 'The aim of this article is to present an approach to the analysis of simple
  systems composed of a large number of units in interaction. Suppose to have a large
  number of agents belonging to a finite number of different groups: as the agents
  randomly interact with each other, they move from a group to another as a result
  of the interaction. The object of interest is the stochastic process describing
  the number of agents in each group. As this is generally intractable, it has been
  proposed in the literature to approximate it in several ways. We review these approximations
  and we illustrate them with reference to a version of the epidemic model. The tools
  presented in the paper should be considered as a complement rather than as a substitute
  of the classical analysis of ABMs through simulation.'
