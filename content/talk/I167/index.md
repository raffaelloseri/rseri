abstract: "Scientific inquiry often hinges on selecting models that adequately
capture the phenomena under investigation, by employing different
strategies and toolkits based on modeling purposes and contexts of
analysis. Within this landscape, the theory of model selection has
been broadly constructed around two primary focuses. On the one hand,
philosophers of science emphasize the conceptual integrity of models
(e.g., Gr√ºne-Yanoff and Marchionni, 2018, Tieleman, 2022),
that is how well a model\textquoteright s structure aligns with theoretical
frameworks or explanatory aims. On the other hand, econometricians
focus on output adequacy measured through criteria such as predictive
performance, hypothesis testing, and information criteria (e.g., Hotelling, 
1958, Box, 1979, Myung, 2000, Spanos, 2021).
Striking a balance between these perspectives remains a central challenge,
with both practical and theoretical implications. In fact, while most
models are usually scrutinized separately in their theoretical consistency
and empirical performance, the prerequisite for enacting the latter
\emph{vis a vis} the former, that is the unambigous distinction among
different families of models on the same phenomenon, remains unfulfilled.
This paper aims at elucidating such necessary prerequisites and proposes
a unified framework for model selection that leverages Utility Theory
as the central criterion, integrating both conceptual and statistical
evaluations into a single decision-making process. In doing so, the
framework relies and enhances the analogical understanding within
the field of model theory (Bartha, 2010, Knuuttila and Loettgers, 2017)."
